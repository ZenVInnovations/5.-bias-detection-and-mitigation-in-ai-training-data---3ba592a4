# AI Training Data Bias Detection and Mitigation

This project provides tools and utilities for detecting and mitigating various types of bias in AI training data. It helps ensure fairness and equity in machine learning models by identifying and addressing potential biases in the training data.

## Features

- Detection of multiple bias types:
  - Gender bias
  - Racial bias
  - Age bias
  - Socioeconomic bias
  - Geographic bias
  - Language bias

- Bias mitigation strategies:
  - Reweighting
  - Resampling
  - Data augmentation
  - Adversarial debiasing

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from bias_detection import BiasDetector
from bias_mitigation import BiasMitigator

# Initialize detector
detector = BiasDetector()

# Analyze dataset for bias
bias_report = detector.analyze_dataset(your_dataset)

# Mitigate detected biases
mitigator = BiasMitigator()
debiased_dataset = mitigator.mitigate(your_dataset, bias_report)
```
